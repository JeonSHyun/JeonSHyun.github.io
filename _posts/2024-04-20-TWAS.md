## Transcriptome-wide association study (TWAS)
TWAS is a gene-prioritization approach that detects trait-associated genes regulated by significant variants, primarily single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) identified from genome-wide association study (GWAS). 
Briefly, TWAS first trains a genetic regulation model of genetic components and gene expression from a small available reference panel. 
These models with regulatory weights are used to impute gene expression for individuals of larger GWAS cohorts. 
Finally, the associations between predictive gene expression and traits are calculated to determine the regulatory relationship between genes and traits.

### Advantages of TWAS
- Higher gene-based interpretability than GWAS. Although GWAS has identified numerous significant variants, most are in non-coding regions and are hard to interpret. As genes are functioning and more explainable units than variants, the gene-trait associations detected by TWAS are more sensible for explaining the genetic mechanism of phenotypes. 
- Lower computing complexity and experimental cost. Compared to genome loci-based analysis, TWAS conducts association tests only for genes significantly regulated by genetic variations, thus relieving the multiple testing burden. Besides, as it narrows the range of candidate genes, this method can save time and labor costs for following experiments. 
- Tissue specificity. Most disease investigations are based on specific pathological tissues. By targeting relevant and functional tissues, TWAS detects trait-associated gene panels to better reveal the underlying pathological mechanisms for diverse diseases in a tissue-specific manner. 
- Higher statistical power than other gene-based analyses. Facing limited samples with expression data due to finite bio-samples and the high cost of RNA sequencing, TWAS highlights imputing gene expression of large-scale GWAS samples and thus significantly improves the statistical ability of association testing. 
- Leverage genetic regulation information. TWAS builds an expression imputation model from expression quantitative loci (eQTL) data and thus identifies genetically-regulated genes associated with traits, even if they are far from the variants.
