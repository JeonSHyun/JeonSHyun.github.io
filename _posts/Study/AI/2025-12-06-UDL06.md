# Convolutional Neural Networks

## Networks for images

Problems with fully-connected networks
* Size
* Nearby pixels statistically related
  * But could permute pixels and relearn and get same results with FC
* Should be stable under transformations
  * Don’t want to re-learn appearance at different parts of image

Convolutional networks
* Parameters only look at local image patches
* Share parameters across image

## Invariance and equivariance

### Invariance
A function $f[x]$ is invariant to a transformation $t$ if $f[t[x]] = f[x]$.
The function output is the same even after the transformation is applied.

e.g., Image has been translated, but we want our classifier to give the same result

### Equivariance
A function $f[x]$ is equivariant to a transformation $t$ if $f[t[x]] = t[f[x]]$.
The output is transformed in the same way as the input.

e.g., Image has been translated and we want segmentation to translate with it.
