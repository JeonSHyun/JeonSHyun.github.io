# Exploratory Data Analysis & Data Visualization

## Research Paradigms
* Hypothesis-Driven Research
  * Background Research
  * Develop hypothesis
  * Select System and Design Experiment
  * Apply Assay(s)
  * Interpret Data, Refine, And Extend Hypothesis
* Hypothesis-Generating Research
  * Background Research
  * Select System
  * Generate High Throughput Data + Gather Related Public Dataset
  * Explore Data for Patterns
  * Refine, Extend, And Validate Hypothesis

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Data analysis approach prioritizing investigation and understanding over immediate confirmation.

* Process: Analyzing datasets to summarize characteristics, often using visualization methods.
* Core Idea: Examine data thoroughly before making assumptions or proceeding with formal modeling.
* Focus
  * Examining data for inherent patterns
  * Identifying outliers/anomalies
  * Understanding variable distributions
  * Uncovering underlying structure
* Contrast: Less concerned with rigid statistical modeling or formal inference initially

## The Philosophy of EDA
John Ukey's Emphasis: EDA is more than just techniques

* Attitude: Be open-minded, let the data guide
* Flexibility: Adapt the analysis based on what the data reveals
* Reliance on Display: Use graphical methods extensively to see patterns

## EDA vs. Confirmatory Data Analysis
### Confirmatory Data Analysis
Goal: Test pre-defined hypotheses.

Questions: Answer specific, preformulated questions.

Role: Formal statistical testing and inference.

### Exploratory Data Analysis
Goal: Discovery, pattern finding, understanding the data.

Questions: Formulate the right questions to ask.

Role: Crucial precursor; helps determine if planned statistical methods are appropriate.
