# DNA Sequencing Technology

## First Generation DNA Sequencing

### Sanger DNA Sequencing
Sanger DNA sequencing uses ddNTPs and capillary electrophoresis to determine the nucleotide sequence of DNA.
* ABI Prism 3700
  * The ABI Prism 3700 uses fluorescently labeled ddNTPs and capillary electrophoresis to analyze DNA sequences.
  * In capillary electrophoresis, DNA fragments are separated by size as they move through a capillary under an electric field, with smaller fragments moving faster than larger ones.
* Lee Hood automation
  * Used fluorescently labeled ddNTPs to synthesize DNA and analyzes it with automated machines

### Maxam-Gilbert method
The Maxam-Gilbert method is a DNA sequencing technique based on degradation, where 5â€² ends are radiolabeled and various chemical treatments are used: formic acid for A+G, dimethyl sulfate for G, hydrazine for C+T, and hydrazine+NaCl for C.
It often requires concentration adjustments.
