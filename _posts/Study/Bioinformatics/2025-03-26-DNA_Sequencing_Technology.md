# DNA Sequencing Technology

## First Generation DNA Sequencing

### Sanger DNA Sequencing
Sanger DNA sequencing uses ddNTPs and capillary electrophoresis to determine the nucleotide sequence of DNA.
* ABI Prism 3700
  * The ABI Prism 3700 uses fluorescently labeled ddNTPs and capillary electrophoresis to analyze DNA sequences.
  * In capillary electrophoresis, DNA fragments are separated by size as they move through a capillary under an electric field, with smaller fragments moving faster than larger ones.
* Lee Hood automation
  * Used fluorescently labeled ddNTPs to synthesize DNA and analyzes it with automated machines

### Maxam-Gilbert method
The Maxam-Gilbert method is a DNA sequencing technique based on degradation, where 5â€² ends are radiolabeled and various chemical treatments are used: formic acid for A+G, dimethyl sulfate for G, hydrazine for C+T, and hydrazine+NaCl for C.
It often requires concentration adjustments.

## Second Generation DNA Sequencing

### The process of second-generation sequencing
* Library preparation
* Cluster formation
* Sequencing reaction and imaging
* Image analysis and base calling

### 454 Sequencing
* Share DNA
* Add adaptors
* Attach to beads. Trap in oil droplet micro-reactors
* Amplify w/PCR
* Trap DNA-coated beads in wells (up to 1 million)

### Pyrosequencing: luciferase from fireflies
Protocol
* Hybridize sequencing primer
* Add DNA polymerase, ATP sulfurylase, luciferase, apyrase & substrates (adenosine 5' phosphosulfate (APS) and luciferin)
* Nucleotide incorporation catalyzes chain reaction that results in light
* Add bases sequentially, and repeat ~500 times

### 454 sequencing: summary
First post-Sanger technology (2005).

Used to sequence may microorganisms & Jim Watson's genome (for $2M in 2007).

Longer reads than Illumina, but much lower yield (~500bp).

Rapidly outpaced by other technologies - now essentially obsolete.

### Illumina sequencing
