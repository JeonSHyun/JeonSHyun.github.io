# Biology of Genomes

## Maps and Tour Guides

Maps are essential in revealing the organizatoin of the heriditary material.

Different types of map describe different types of observations:
* Linkage maps of genes
* Banding patterns of chromosomes
* Restriction maps
* DNA cleavage fragment patterns
* DNA sequences

## Linkage Maps
Inverse of the recombination rate between two genes in the same chromosome suggest their distance.

## Centromere Positioning
Centromere position can be described three ways: metacentric, submetacentric, acrocentric.

In metacentric chromosomes, the centromere lies near the center of the chromosome.

Submetacentric chromosomes have a centromere that is off-center, so that one chromosome arm is longer than the other.
The short arm is designated "p" (for petite), and the long arm is designated "q" (because it follows the letter "p").

In acrocentric chromosomes, the centromere is very near one end.
Human chromosomes 13, 14, 15, 21, 22, and Y are acrocentric.
The p arms of acrocentric chromosomes in humans contain a high density of rDNA genes. 
These genes are involved in development and can flexibly adjust their length.

## Chromosome Banding
Heterochromatic regions, which tend to be rich with adenine and thymine (AT-rich) DNA and relatively gene-poor, stain more darkly with Giemsa and result in G-banding.
Less condensed (open) chromatin, which tends to be GC-rich and more transcriptionally active, incorporates less Giemsa stain, resulting in light bands in G-banding.

Cytogenetic bands are labeled p1, p2, p3, q1, q2, q3, ect., counting from the centromere out toward the telomeres.
At high resolutions, sub-bands can be seen within the bands.

For example, 7q31.2 indicates it is on chromosome 7, q arm, region3, band 1, and sub-band 2.
