Meta-analysis is a method of synthesis of quantitative data from multiple independent studies addressing a common research question.
An important part of this method involves computing a combined effect size across all of the studies. 
As such, this statistical approach involves extracting effect sizes and variance measures from various studies. 
By combining these effect sizes the statistical power is improved and can resolve uncertainties or discrepancies found in individual studies. 
Meta-analyses are integral in supporting research grant proposals, shaping treatment guidelines, and influencing health policies. 
They are also pivotal in summarizing existing research to guide future studies, thereby cementing their role as a fundamental methodology in metascience. 
Meta-analyses are often important components of a systematic review.
