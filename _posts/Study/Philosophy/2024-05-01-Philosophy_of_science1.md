## Commonalities in research methods
* Sophisticated observation
* Experimentation
* Multiple lines of evidence
* Accumulation of evidence over time


## Scientific Empiricism
The idea that all of our scientific knowledge should ultimately come from unbiased observations of the world.

### Evidence
Circumstantial evidence is the evidence that tends to prove a fact by proving other events or circumstances which afford a basis for a reasonable inference of the occurrence of the fact at issue.
Causal evidence is the evidence that documents relationship between an activity, treatment, or intervention (including technology) and its intended outcomes.

### Double blind
Single-blind studies blind patients to their treatment allocation, double-blind studies blind both patients and researchers to treatment allocations, and triple-blinded studies blind patients, researcher, and some other third party (such as a monitoring committee) to treatment allocations.

### Observation
Observations are public. 
Public observation ought to be free of bias.
Science helps us to learn about the world, not the products of our own minds.

Observation should be thought of as reliable detection. 
We observe in this technical sense when we use a combination of our senses and technology to reliably detect something in the world. 
Understood this way in some domains sensors are video cameras are often more reliable than our own senses. 
So when we say that the foundation of science is empirical or observational we should understand it in this way.
The foundation is the reliable detection of what's in the world.

### Scientific knowledge

#### Straight observation (observation)
The most fundamental source of scientific knowledge. 
It involves using our senses, perhaps augmented with instrumentation, to discover what happened in the past, what is happening now, and to discover patterns and dependencies. 
To be a little more precise, scientists observe single instances or snapshots of the way that the world is. 
We can call these things events. 
But scientists often make repeated observations or look for patterns and distributions in their observations.
These more generalized observations are called phenomena.

#### Experiment
Two reasons why interventions are so important: to create a phenomenon; to isolate a phenomenon.

#### Simulation
A simulation consists of a model and initial conditions. 
We can think of a model as a representation of some real or imagined part of the world, and the initial conditions as the starting point.

##### Are they really empirical and how can we be sure if they're reliable?

Similarities between experiments and simulations: scientists create conditions to test what happens when one or just a few variables are manipulated. 
Although experimental systems are physically in the world in the way that most models are not, experimental manipulations happen on experimental systems, which are often modified versions of what we'd find in the world.

Moreover, the components of models and the initial conditions of the models are of course based on prior observations about the world.

Despite possibly seeming not empirical, simulations really are thoroughly empirical. 
We can think of simulations as a tool for exploring the consequences effects that we have determined empirically, or facts that we would need to further investigate empirically.

Then, how do we know we haven't neglected some important process or factor that will be important in the future?
How do we know that the future will resemble the past in the important respects?
How do we know that there isn't an additional consideration we've neglected?
Openness to the possibility that some as-yet-undiscovered factor will prove to be important.


### Mill's methods
To establish a causal relationship between two or more groups of data, analyzing their respective differences and similarities.

#### Method of agreement
If two or more instances of the phenomenon under investigation have only one circumstance in common, the circumstance in which alone all the instances agree, is the cause (or effect) of the given phenomenon.

#### Method of disagreement
If an instance in which the phenomenon under investigation occurs, and an instance in which it does not occur, have every circumstance save one in common, that one occurring only in the former; the circumstance in which alone the two instances differ, is the effect, or cause, or an indispensable part of the cause, of the phenomenon.
