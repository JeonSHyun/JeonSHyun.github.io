# Introduction to Genetics
## Genetics Progressed from Mendel to DNA in Less Than a Century

### The Chromosome Theory of Inheritance: Uniting Mendel and Meiosis

Chromosomes in diploid (2n) cells exist in pairs, called homologous chromosomes.

In mitosis, chromosomes are copied and distributed so that each daughter cell receive a diploid set of chromoomes identical to those in the parental cell.

Meiosis is associated with gamete formation.
Cells produced by meiosis receive only one chromosome from each chromosome pair, and the resulting number of chromosomes is called the haploid number (n).

The chromosome theory of inheritance explains how genetic infomration is transmitted from generation to generation.

### Genetic Variation

Mutations are any heritable change in the DNA sequence and are the source of all genetic variation.

Allele are defined as alternative forms of a gene.
Different alleles may produce differences in the observable features, or phenotype, of an organism.

The se of alleles for a given trait carried by an organism is called the genotype.

## Discovery of the Double Helix Launched the Era of Molecular Genetics

### The Structure of DNA and RNA

In DNA, there are four different nucleotides, each of which contains a nitrogenous base, A (adenine), G (guanine), T (thymine), or C (cytosine).

The two strands of DNA are exact complements of one another, so that the rungs of the ladder in the double helix always consist of A-T and G-C base pairs.

RNA is generally a single-stranded modlecule.
