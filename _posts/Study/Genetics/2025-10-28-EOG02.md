# Mitosis and Meiosis
An organism's DNA, with its arrays of genes, is organized into structures called chromosomes, which serve as vehicles for transmitting genetic information.

Two major processes are involved in the genetic continuity of nucleated cells: mitosis and meiosis.
Mitosis leads to the production of two cells, each with the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell.
In contrast, meiosis reduces the genetic content and the number of chromosomes by precisely half.
This reduction is essential if sexual reproduction is to occur without doubling the amount of genetic material in each new generation.
Meiosis is part of a speccial type of cell division that leads to the production of sex cells: gametes or spores.
This process is an essential step in the transmission of genetic information from an organism to its offspring.

Normally, chromosomes are visible only during mitosis and meiosis.
When cells are not undergoing division, the genetic material making up chromosomes unfolds and uncoils into a diffuse network within the nucleus, generally referred to as chromatin.
