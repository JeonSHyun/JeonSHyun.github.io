# Matrix Algebra

## Matrix Notation
$A = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & . & a_{1n} \\\ . & . & . \\\ a_{m1} & . & . & . & a_{mn} \end{bmatrix}$

To transpose a matrix:
$A = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & a_{13} \\\ a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} \end{bmatrix}$

$A' = A^T = A^t = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{21} \\\ a_{12} & a_{22} \\\ a_{13} & a_{23} \end{bmatrix}$

If $A = A^T$, the matrix is called symmetric (m = n)

## Special symmetric matrix

### Identity matrix
$I_3 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$

### Diagonal matrix
diag($a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$)

## Basic property
For $A = B$ both matrices must be of the same size and $a_{ij} = b_{ij}$.

Equality is transitive: $C = A + B \Leftrightarrow c_{ij} = a_{ij} + b_{ij}$

Matrix addition and subtraction are commutative and associative
* $A \pm B = B \pm A$
* $(A \pm B) \pm C = A \pm (B \pm C)$
* $(A \pm B)^T = A^T \pm B^T$

## Multiplication
Scalar multiplication: $B = kA \Leftrightarrow b_{ij} = k a_{ij}$

Two forms of multiplication
* $C = AB$: A premultiplies B
* $C = BA$: A postmultiplies B

For multiplication to be possible the number of columns in $A$ must equal the number of rows in $B$.

If $A = (m \times p)$, and $B = (p \times n)$, then $C = AB = (m \times n)$ and $C_{ij} = \sum_{k = 1}^p a_{ik} b_{kj}$

In general, $AB \neq BA$, except when
* Both matrices are diagonal
* Scalar multiplication
* When one matrix is an identity matrix

## Inner product
An inner product is the product of a row vector and a column vector.
If $J = (T \times 1)$ with all elements 1, $J^t J = T$.

Two vectors are orthogonal if their inner product = 0.

The inner product is commutative: $a^T b = b^T a$.

Square-root of the inner product of a vector with itself is called euclidean vector norm: $\mid J \mid  = \sqrt{J^t T}$

For multiplication, the distributive law holds: $A(B+C) = AB + AC$.

As does the associative law: $A(BC) = (AB)C$.

The cancellation law does not hold.

If $AB = 0$, then it does not follow that $A$ or $B$ or both are 0.

## Transpose of a product
$(AB)^T = B^T A^T$

If $A = A^T$ and $B = B^T$, then $(AB)^T = B^T A^T = BA$ does not necessarily $=AB$.

If $A$ is symmetric but $B$ is not, note that $B^T AB$ is symmetric since $(B^T AB)^T = B^T A^T B = B^T AB$.

### Trace
The trace of a matrix $tr(A) = a_{11} + a_{22} + \ldots + a_{nn}$
* $tr(A^T) = tr(A)$
* $tr(kA) = ktr(A)$
* $tr(I_n) = n$

If $A$ and $B$ are square, 
* $tr(A + B) = tr(A) + tr(B)$
* $tr(AB) = tr(BA)$
* $tr(ABC) = tr(BCA) = tr(CAB)$

### Determinant
The determinant of matrix $det A$ or $\mid A \mid$

$A = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{21} \\\ a_{12} & a_{22} \end{bmatrix} \Rightarrow \mid A \mid = a_{11} a_{22} - a_{12} a_{21}$

$A = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{21} & a_{13} \\\ a_{12} & a_{22} & a_{23} \\\ a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33} \end{bmatrix}$

$\Rightarrow \mid A \mid = a_{11} \mid \begin{bmatrix} a_{22} & a_{33} \\\ a_{23} & a_{32} \end{bmatrix} \mid - a_{12} \mid \begin{bmatrix} a_{21} & a_{23} \\\ a_{31} & a_{33} \end{bmatrix} \mid + a_{13} \mid \begin{bmatrix} a_{21} & a_{22} \\\ a_{31} & a_{32} \end{bmatrix} \mid$

$= a_{11} (a_{22} a_{33} - a_{23} a_{32}) - a_{12} (a_{21} a_{33} - a{23} a_{31}) + a_{13} (a_{21} a_{32} - a_{22} a_{31})$

$(a_{22} a_{33} - a_{23} a_{32})$ is called the minor of $a_{11}$ and is usually denoted $\mid A_{ij} \mid$, in this case $\mid A_{11} \mid$

### Cofactor
The cofactor of the elements of $a_{ij}$ denoted by $c_{ij}$ is $c_{ij} = (-1)^{i + j} \mid A_{ij} \mid$

$\mid A \mid = \sum_{j = 1}^n a_{ij} c_{ij} = \sum_i^n a_{ij} c_{ij}$

## Properties of determinants
1. $\mid A^T \mid = \mid A \mid$
2. $\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{21} \\\ k a_{12} & k a_{22} \end{bmatrix} = k \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{21} \\\ a_{12} & a_{22} \end{bmatrix}$
3. If $A$ is $(n \times n)$ then $\mid kA \mid = k^n \mid A \mid$
4. If a square matrix has two equal rows or columns its determinant is zero
5. If any row (or column) is the multiple of any other row (or column) then its determinant is zero
6. The value of a determinant is  unchanged if a multiple of one row (or column) is added to another row (or column)
7. If $A$ is a diagonal matrix of order $n$, then its determinant is $a_{11} a_{22} \ldots a_{nn}$
8. If $A$ is a triangular matrix of order $n$, then its determinant is $a_{11} a_{22} \ldots a_{nn}$
9. If $B$ is the matrix obtained from a square matrix $A$ by interchanging any two rows (or columns), then $\det(B) = -\det(A)$
  * $A = \begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{21} \\\ a_{12} & a_{22} \end{bmatrix}$
  * $B = \begin{bmatrix} a_{21} & a_{11} \\\ a_{12} & a_{22} \end{bmatrix}$
10. If $A$ and $B$ are square matrices of the same order, then $\mid AB \mid = \mid A \mid \mid B \mid$
11. If $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_s$ are square matrices, then $\mid diag(A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_s) \mid = \mid A_1 \mid \mid A_2 \mid \ldots \mid A_s \mid$
12. In general, $\mid A + B \mid$ does not equal $\mid A \mid + \mid B \mid$

## Rank
The rank of a matrix is equal to the highest order non-zero determinant that can be formed from its sub-matrices.
The rank of a matrix can also be measured by the maximum number of linearily independent columns of $A$.
This also equals the maximum number of linearily independent rows.

### Full column/row rank
A full column rank matrix has the same number of linearily indepenent columns (rows) equal to the number of columns.

A full row rank matrix has the same number of linearily independent rows (columns) equal to the number of rows.

### Singular and non-singular matrix
If $A$ does not have full row and column rank, it is singular (no inverse matrix).

If $A$ does have full row and column rank, it is non-singular.

* rank $(I_n) = n$
* rank $(kA)$ = rank($A$)
* rank $(A^T)$ = rank($A$)
* If $A$ is $(m \times n)$, then rank($A$) is $\leq$ min{ $m, n$ }
* rank $AB \leq$ min{rank($A$), rank($B$)}
