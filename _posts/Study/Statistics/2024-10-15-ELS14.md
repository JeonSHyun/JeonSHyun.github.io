# Unsupervised Learning

## Introduction

### Supervised learning
Supervised learning is a method in which a model is trained to make predictions by learning from a dataset that includes both input data and the corresponding labels

### Unsupervised learning
Unsupervised learning is a method where only input data is provided, without labels or correct answers.
The lack of clear metrics to measure the effectiveness of algorithms leads to the proposal of various learning methods.


## Association Rules
Association rule analysis has emerged as a popular tool for mining commercial data bases.
The goal is to find joint values of the variables $X = (X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_p)$ that appear most frequently in the data base.

$Pr(\cap_{j = 1}^p (X_j \in s_j)), X_j \in \\{0, 1\\}$


### The Apriori algorithm
One of the major advances in data mining technology.
A method for finding frequent item sets and generating association rules based on them.

#### The metrics for measuring association rules
* Support: $T(A \Rightarrow B)$
* Confidence: $C(A \Rightarrow B) = \frac{T(A \Rightarrow B)}{T(A)}$
* Lift: $L(A \Rightarrow B) = \frac{C(A \Rightarrow B)}{T(B)}$


### Unsupervised as supervised learning
Let $g(x)$ be the unknown data probability density to be estimated, and $g_0(x)$ be a specified probability density function used for reference.

$N$ random samples were drawn from $g(x)$ and $N_0$ samples can be drawn from $g_0(x)$ using Monte Carlo methods. 
They results in a random sample drawn from the mixture density $(g(x) + g_0(x))/2$.

If one assigns the value $Y = 1$ 1 to each sample point drawn from $g(x)$ and $Y = 0$ those drawn from $g_0(x)$, then,

$\mu(x) = E(Y \mid x) = \frac{g(x)}{g(x) + g_0(x)} = \frac{g(x) / g_0(x)}{1 + g(x) / g_0(x)}$

The resulting estimate $\hat{\mu}(x)$ can be inverted to provide an estimate for $g(x)$

$\hat{g}(x) = g_0(x) \frac{\hat{\mu}(x)}{1 - \hat{\mu}(x)}$
