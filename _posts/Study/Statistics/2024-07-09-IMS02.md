# Random Variables

## Definition
For sample space $S$, a function $X$, which assigns to $c \in S$ only one number $X(c) = x$

i.e., $X$: random variable $\Leftrightarrow X:S \rightarrow R$

Random variable is defined on the element of sample space

The probability set function, $P$, is defined on the subset of sample space

### Relationship between probability set function and random variable
In our notion, we define that for $A \subset R$

$X^{-1}\{A\} \equiv \{c \in S: X(c) \in A\}$: make sure that $X^{-1}/{A/}$ indicates the inverse image of $A$

$P(X^{-1}\{A\}) \equiv P(X \in A) \equiv P_X(A)$

For example, $\{c \in S: X(c) \leq a\} = X^{-1}\{(-\infty, a\]\}$
