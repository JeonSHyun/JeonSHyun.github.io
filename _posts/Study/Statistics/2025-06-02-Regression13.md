# Logistic Regression

## Regression Analysis and Categorical Data Analysis

Earlier chapters
* Dependent variable: quantitative
* Independent variable: quantitative or qualitative

This chapter
* Dependent variatle: qualitative
* Independent variable: quantitative or qualitative

## Modeling Qualitative Data
Rather than predicting these two values of the binary response variable, we try to model the probabilities that the response takes one of these two values.

Let $\pi$ denote the probability that $Y=1$ when $X=x$.

If we use the standard linear model, we cannot model probability; $\pi = Pr(Y=1 \mid X=x) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon$.
* LHS lies between 0 and 1 while RHS is unbounded

### Logistic model
Therefore, in logistic model, $\log \frac{\pi}{1-\pi} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x$.
Then, $\pi = Pr(Y=1 \mid X=x) = \frac{e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x}}{1 + e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x}}$

$Y \mid X = x \sim B(1, \pi)$.

### Logistic regression function (logistic model for multiple regression)
$\pi = Pr(Y=1 \mid X_1 = x_1, \ldots, X_p = x_p) = \frac{e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \ldots + \beta_p x_p}}{1 + e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \ldots + \beta_p x_p}}$

Nonlinear in the parameters $\beta_0, \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_p$ but it can be linearized by the logit transformation
