# Introduction
## Correlation vs. Causality
Most statistical analyses deal with correlation

## Regression Analysis
Statistical analysis of functional relationships between outcome and causative variables

$Y = f(X1, X2, \ldots) + \epsilon$
* Response variable (Y) = outcome variable = dependent variable
* Explanatory variable (X) = predictor variable = independent variable

The causal relationship by regression analysis is set before analysis by theoretical and empirical validity, not after analysis.

### Purpose of regression analysis
* To clearly determine the regression equation through regression analysis
* Evaluation of the importance of individual explanatory variables
* Analyzing the effectiveness of policies that include changing those values
* Prediction of the value of the response variable for the value of the given explanatory variables

## Type of regression analysis
* Functional relationship: linear vs. non-linear
* Number of explanatory variable: simple vs. multiple
* Number of response variable: univariate vs. multivariate

## Regression model
* Simple linear regression: $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \epsilon$
* Multiple linear regression: $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \ldots + \beta_p X_p + \epsilon$
* Non-linear regression: $Y = \frac{\exp (\beta_0 + \beta_1 X)}{1 + \exp (\beta_0 + \beta_1 X)} + \epsilon$
* Multivariate regression:
  * $Y_1 = \beta_{10} + \beta_{11} X_1 + \beta_{12} X_2 + \ldots + \beta_{1p} X_p + \epsilon_1$
  * $Y_2 = \beta_{20} + \beta_{21} X_1 + \beta_{22} X_2 + \ldots + \beta_{2p} X_p + \epsilon_2$
  * $Y_3 = \beta_{30} + \beta_{31} X_1 + \beta_{32} X_2 + \ldots + \beta_{3p} X_p + \epsilon_3$

$Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X + \beta_2 X^2 + \epsilon$ and $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \log X + \epsilon$ are also linear regression

## Type of variable
* Quantitative variable: a variable whose data properties themselves are numerically represented
* Qualitative variable (categorical): a variable measured to classify an individual and cannot in principle be represented by numbers
  * Nominal type: only categorize objects (e.g., gender)
  * Ordinal type: have an order (e.g., grade)

## Select the analysis method based on the type of data
* X = qualitative, Y = qualitative: Chi-squared Test, logistic regression
* X = qualitative, Y = quantitative: analysis of variance (ANOVA), Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA)
* X = quantitative, Y = qualitative: logistic regression
* X = quantitative, Y = quantitative: regression analysis, ANCOVA
