# Model inference
Inference is a process of using a trained model to infere a result from live data.


# Bootstrap and Maximum Likelihood

## Parametric bootstrap is closer to MLE than LSE

### Parametric bootstrap
Generating new datasets by using the estimated parameters of a model.
If a model assumes the data follows a normal distribution with a certain mean and variance, the parametric bootstrap uses theses parameters to create new simulated datasets.
In general, the parametric bootstrap agrees not with least squares but with maximum likelihood.

### Maximum Likelihood Estimation
Finding the parameter values that maximize the likelihood of observing the given data.

### Least Squres Estimation
Finding the parameter values that minimize the sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the values predicted by the model.
