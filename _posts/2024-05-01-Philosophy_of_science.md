## Commonalities in research methods

* Sophisticated observation
* Experimentation
* Multiple lines of evidence
* Accumulation of evidence over time


## Scientific Empiricism
The idea that all of our scientific knowledge should ultimately come from unbiased observations of the world.

### Evidence
Circumstantial evidence is the evidence that tends to prove a fact by proving other events or circumstances which afford a basis for a reasonable inference of the occurrence of the fact at issue.
Causal evidence is the evidence that documents relationship between an activity, treatment, or intervention (including technology) and its intended outcomes.

### Double blind
Single-blind studies blind patients to their treatment allocation, double-blind studies blind both patients and researchers to treatment allocations, and triple-blinded studies blind patients, researcher, and some other third party (such as a monitoring committee) to treatment allocations.

### Observation
Observations are public. 
Public observation ought to be free of bias.
Science helps us to learn about the world, not the products of our own minds.

### Scientific knowledge

#### Straight observation (observation)
The most fundamental source of scientific knowledge. 
It involves using our senses, perhaps augmented with instrumentation, to discover what happened in the past, what is happening now, and to discover patterns and dependencies. 
To be a little more precise, scientists observe single instances or snapshots of the way that the world is. 
We can call these things events. 
But scientists often make repeated observations or look for patterns and distributions in their observations. 
These more generalized observations are called phenomena.

#### Experiment
#### Simulation
