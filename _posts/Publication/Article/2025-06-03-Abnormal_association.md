## Abstract
### Background
Impulsivity in highly heritable attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been studied using neural activity via functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or genetic data, but rarely with multivariate methods that link both. We investigated coupled neural activity and gene expression signatures, using parallel independent component analysis (pICA) and ABCD (Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development) Study data.
### Methods
Children with ADHD (n = 394; 63% male) and healthy control children (n = 1000; 47% male) of European ancestry were included. The participants were randomly divided into 80% discovery and 20% replication datasets with demographic stratification. We analyzed neural activity and gene expressions from the discovery datasets using pICA and extracted paired independent components (pICs). The loading coefficients of the pICs were utilized to predict behavioral and cognitive data for a stop signal task (SST) in replication datasets.
### Results
We identified 3 pICs estimated from gene expression in the cortex, cerebellum, and nucleus accumbens. Significant neural activity was mainly localized to the orbital/inferior/middle frontal gyri, rectal gyrus, precuneus, inferior temporal gyrus, inferior parietal lobule, and cerebellum. Significant gene components were associated with immunoglobulin-, taste receptor–, and immunity-related terms and overlapped with ADHD-related genes. The extracted fMRI-/gene-ICs were significantly correlated with mean reaction time, stop signal reaction time on the SST, and behavioral inhibition, with a large boost in sensitivity when both the paired fMRI-/gene-ICs and their interaction were used in a multimodal regression analysis.
### Conclusions
We reported biologically plausible pairs of neural activity and gene sets using pICA, which were significantly associated with ADHD impulsivity–related behavioral and cognitive data.
