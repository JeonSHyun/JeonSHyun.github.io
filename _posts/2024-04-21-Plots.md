## Volcano plot
A volcano plot is a type of scatter-plot that is used to quickly identify changes in large data sets composed of replicate data.
It plots significance versus fold-change on the y and x axes, respectively. 
These plots are increasingly common in omic experiments where one often has a list of many thousands of replicate data points between two conditions and one wishes to quickly identify the most meaningful changes. 
A volcano plot combines a measure of statistical significance from a statistical test (e.g., a p value from an ANOVA model) with the magnitude of the change, enabling quick visual identification of those data-points that display large magnitude changes that are also statistically significant.

A volcano plot is constructed by plotting the negative logarithm of the p value on the y axis (usually base 10), and plotting the logarithm of the fold change between the two conditions on the x axis.
