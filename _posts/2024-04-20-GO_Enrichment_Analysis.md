## Gene ontology (GO)
The GO provides a framework and set of concepts for describing the functions of gene products from all organisms. 
It is specifically designed for supporting the computational representation of biological systems. 
A GO annotation is an association between a specific gene product and a GO concept, together making a statement pertinent to the function of that gene. 


### Three categories of GO

#### Biological process (BP)
BP refers to a biological objective to which the gene or gene product contributes. 
A process is accomplished via one or more ordered assemblies of molecular functions. 
Processes often involve a chemical or physical transformation, in the sense that something goes into a process and something different comes out of it. 

#### Molecular function (MF)
MF is defined as the biochemical activity (including specific binding to ligands or structures) of a gene product. 
This definition also applies to the capability that a gene product (or gene product complex) carries as a potential. 
It describes only what is done without specifying where or when the event actually occurs. 

#### Cellular component (CC)
CC refers to the place in the cell where a gene product is active. 
These terms reflect our understanding of eukaryotic cell structure. 
As is true for the other ontologies, not all terms are applicable to all organisms; the set of terms is meant to be inclusive.
